\chapter*{Appendices}
The attached optical medium has this content:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt docker/} -- The directory with the containers and used scripts.
\item {\tt tex/} -- Latex source code, and data used in this work in {\tt
	results} subdirectory.
\item {\tt xfsprogs-dev/} -- The directory with xfsprogs git repository.
Includes also the changes that were not yet merged in {\tt conflicts}
branch.
\end{itemize}

The {\tt docker/} directory contains subdirectories for every
container, plus these scripts, which are described in \Cref{chap:techniques}:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt prepare.sh} -- A script that will download sources for the docker
containers. Not necessary when the directories already exists.
\item {\tt tests.py} -- A script that runs all the tests.
\item {\tt format-outputs.sh} -- A script to preprocess the output of the used
tools for later analysis.
\item {\tt parse.py} -- A simple analysis of the outputs, capable of
printing differences between revisions.
\item {\tt README.md} -- An example of how to use these scripts.
\end{itemize}
