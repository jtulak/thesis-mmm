At this moment, in January 2017, the refactoring is probably mostly finished. About half of the changes is already in the upstream repository, while the other half awaits review. The review process can take some time as it is likely that there will be multiple iterations, but I don't expect any big changes.

Once all the changes are merged, I can begin the testing, with one notable exception: Coverity scan is used during the development because xfsprogs is using the Coverity Scan program for open-source projects.
