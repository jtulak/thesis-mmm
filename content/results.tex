If not stated otherwise, the number of issues is for mkfs-specific files.
That is, for files in {\tt mkfs/} directory.

\caption{An overview of issues found by the tested tools on specific
	revisions in mkfs-only files.\newline
	\newline
	Legend: Revisions annotated with {\em total issues} shows the
	number of outstanding issues. All other revisions shows new/fixed
	issues.  $+x$ denotes amount of new issues found, $-x$ denotes
	number of issues fixed between this and the previously tested
revision. A single 0 means no new or fixed issue, i.e. a readability
enhancement with the meaning of $+0$/$-0$. A --- dash means that the tool
was not used on this specific revision.}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------
Codacy shows only per-commit and total issues for a branch. That is, a
developer can view whether a specific commit fixed or caused an issue, and
can see what are the issues for the top of the repository, but checking the
complete state on a particular point in the history requires creating a new
branch, which is uncomfortable, but manageable for a private\footnote{In
the sense of being the only user, not in terms of visibility.} repository.
In a repository with many contributors it can be confusing.

\subsection{Version {\tt 4.11-rc1}}
An overview of issues at this revision.
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|l||r|r||r|}
\hline
& {\tt mkfs/xfs\_mkfs.c} & {\tt mkfs/proto.c} & Whole xfsprogs \\
\hline
Issues & 1 & 2 & 937 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{In mkfs-specific files, 3 issues were found. Whole
xfsprogs had 937 issues, from which 900 were code style issue, 36 were
potential errors and 1 was a security issue.}
%\label{tab:results:overview}
\end{table}

The issues found in mkfs are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\tt mkfs/xfs\_mkfs.c}: The scope of the variable 'bucket' can be reduced.
	\item {\tt mkfs/proto.c}: The function 'setup\_proto' is never used.
	\item {\tt mkfs/proto.c}: The function 'parse\_proto' is never used.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Version 4.7}
An overview of issues at this revision.
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|l||r|r|r||r|}
\hline
& {\tt mkfs/xfs\_mkfs.c} & {\tt mkfs/maxtrres.c} & {\tt mkfs/proto.c} & Whole xfsprogs \\
\hline
Issues & 1 & 1 & 2 & 749 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{In mkfs-specific files, 4 issues were found. Whole
xfsprogs had 749 issues, from which 719 were code style issue and 30 were
potential errors.}

The issues found in mkfs are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\tt mkfs/xfs\_mkfs.c}: The scope of the variable 'bucket' can be reduced.
	\item {\tt mkfs/maxtrres.c}: The function 'max\_trans\_res' is never used.
	\item {\tt mkfs/proto.c}: The function 'setup\_proto' is never used.
	\item {\tt mkfs/proto.c}: The function 'parse\_proto' is never used.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Version 4.6}

An overview of issues at this revision.
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|l||r|r||r|}
\hline
& {\tt mkfs/xfs\_mkfs.c} & {\tt mkfs/proto.c} & Whole xfsprogs \\
\hline
Issues & 4 & 2 & 839 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{In mkfs-specific files, 6 issues were found. Whole
xfsprogs had 839 issues, from which 809 were code style issue and 30 were
potential errors.}
%\label{tab:results:overview}
\end{table}

The issues found in mkfs are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\tt mkfs/xfs\_mkfs.c}: Checking if unsigned variable 'blocksize' is less than zero.
	\item {\tt mkfs/xfs\_mkfs.c}: Checking if unsigned variable 'sectorsize' is less than zero.
	\item {\tt mkfs/xfs\_mkfs.c}: Condition '0' is always false
	\item {\tt mkfs/xfs\_mkfs.c}: The scope of the variable 'bucket' can be reduced.
	\item {\tt mkfs/proto.c}: The function 'setup\_proto' is never used.
	\item {\tt mkfs/proto.c}: The function 'parse\_proto' is never used.
\end{enumerate}

All these issues were present for multiple years. Precise dating is
difficult, however, because e.g. issue 1. is blamed for a commit 16 years
old. But at that time, the variable was signed. Thus, the issue appeared
some time later, when the specific variable was turned to unsigned, but not
every use was fully converted.



% ------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Revision 627e74fd}
Fixed 2 issues in {\tt mkfs/xfs\_mkfs.c}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Checking if unsigned variable 'blocksize' is less than zero. (line 1579)
\item Checking if unsigned variable 'sectorsize' is less than zero. (line
								     1705)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Summary}
Codacy provides some rating on the project's page~\cite{codacyXfsprogs},
which considers xfsprogs as a quality project (A-grade).
